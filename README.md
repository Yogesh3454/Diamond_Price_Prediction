# Diamond Price Prediction

This project allows users to predict the price of a diamond based on key parameters such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and dimensions (x, y, z). The project is built using Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and a trained machine learning model for predictions.

## Project Overview

Diamonds are priced based on their unique characteristics, such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, and clarity. Predicting the price of a diamond accurately requires understanding these parameters and leveraging a robust predictive model. This project simplifies this process by offering:

- **Parameter Definitions**: A detailed page explaining key diamond parameters to educate users.
- **Interactive Form**: A user-friendly form where users can input diamond characteristics.
- **Price Prediction**: A machine learning model predicts the diamond price based on the entered parameters.
- **Modern UI**: A responsive and visually appealing design using CSS3.

Whether you are a jeweler, gemologist, or a curious individual, this tool helps you estimate diamond prices efficiently.

## Features

- **Detailed Parameter Insights**: Includes an explanation page for all parameters used in the prediction model.
- **Seamless User Interaction**: Interactive forms for quick data entry.
- **Instant Predictions**: Provides real-time price estimates based on user input.
- **Customizable Design**: Built with HTML and CSS3 for a sleek and professional look.

## Project Workflow
**Parameter Explanation Page:**
Users visit the index.html page, which provides detailed information about the parameters used in diamond price prediction.

**User Input Form:**
On the form.html page, users input the diamond's characteristics (e.g., carat, cut, color, etc.) into the interactive form.

**Model Prediction:**
The data from the form is sent to the Flask backend, where a pre-trained machine learning model predicts the diamond's price.

**Result Display:**
The predicted pr**ice is displayed on the result page with a clean and informative UI.

**Iterative Use:**
Users can refine inputs and re-submit the form for updated predictions.
